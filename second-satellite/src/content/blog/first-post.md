Mahidol Computer Engineering Year 1

Hello, my name is Not. I was born in 2006 and am currently 19 years old, studying in my first year of Computer Engineering at Mahidol University.

To begin with, the reason I chose this major is because I have an interest in the field — although I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about it. For me, it’s simply the safest and most practical path toward my long-term goal: to become a tech entrepreneur. While the exact direction I want to take in business is still unclear, I’m committed to exploring and discovering it throughout my time in university.

My learning strategy is to achieve the best possible results with the least amount of effort. I call it “The Principle of Minimum Effort.” I start by attending every live lecture in person and avoiding online classes as much as possible. Even for foundational courses like Calculus, Physics, and Chemistry — which are available as E-lectures — I prefer being physically present in class. I’ve found that live lectures demand a higher level of focus, which makes a big difference in how well I grasp the material.

Another core part of my strategy is to resolve any questions or confusion I have on the same day the class takes place. Whether it’s by asking the professor, discussing with classmates, reading the textbook, or doing exercises related to that day’s content — I make sure I understand the material thoroughly. This habit also helps me complete homework the same day it's assigned. The more I can clarify things early, the easier and faster it becomes to review for exams later on.

This approach naturally keeps homework under control and allows for continuous revision. So when quizzes or small assessments come up, I’m already prepared. As for midterms or finals, things still require review — but much less stressfully. That said, if I skip proper review in the 1–2 weeks before the exam, even after doing all of the above, my scores tend to be similar to those who didn’t study at all. So I learned that consistent preparation still needs to be followed up with focused review.

There is, of course, another method: skipping lectures and starting to study intensively only during the final 1–2 weeks before the exam. This involves binging lecture videos, doing problem sets, tackling past papers, and repeating that cycle. But in my experience, the stress levels are extremely high with this approach — and it contradicts my "Principle of Minimum Effort."

However, this strategy mostly applies to subjects with clear timelines and scopes. In reality, there are project-based courses where time and effort are harder to predict. For example, in Year 1, Term 1, we had to write a program in C for EGCO111, and in Term 2, a C++ project for EGCO112. There was also MUGE100, which involved long-term projects spanning both terms. Other general education (GE) courses I chose also had similar project-based assignments.

On top of that, there are extracurricular activities from the faculty and university. The time saved from my efficient study method goes directly into participating in those projects and activities — which are also valuable parts of my learning experience.
